# forjure

A compilation of useful clojure macros and tools I plan to make.

## Usage

### Macros
If-let-all: if-let but allows multiple items and checks if any are nil

If-let-last: if-let but allows multiple items and checks if the last item is nil (done)

If-let-on-{all/last} if-let but allows a custom function to be applied to the bindings
